# An intro to ScalaTest for Rubyists

  A repo/playground for exploring various aspects of ScalaTest

# Running tests

  `sbt test`

  Or in the sbt console

  `sbt`

  `test`

# Notes

  The first commit includes the scaffolding of the project built 
  using the sbt scalatest [template](https://github.com/scala/scalatest-example.g8)

  The second commit shows an example of how to test a class (instance methods and class functions) 
  using FunSpec, which is similar to RSpec for Ruby

  A later commit adds the equivalent Ruby and RSpec classes and specs as comments at the bottom of 
  the Scala files for comparison
